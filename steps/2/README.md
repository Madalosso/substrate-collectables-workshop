# Substrate Collectables Workshop: Starting Template

This is the starting template for: https://github.com/shawntabrizi/substrate-collectables-workshop

## Cheat Sheet

You should be able to run all 3 of these commands at the end of every step without any errors or warnings.

```bash
cargo +nightly fmt
cargo +nightly clippy
cargo test
```

I recommend you do this to ensure that you code is always compiles, is well formatted, and all that.
